Optical music recognition (OMR) has been the subject of research for decades. Ideally, an OMR, given an image of a simple or complex music sheet, automatically identifies the notes, and plays the musical piece. An accessible and easy-to-use OMR application could provide an amazing tool for improving the musical education experience. For example, a novice musician could use such a tool to hear what a selected piece of music should sound like.

For this project, our goal is to develop an algorithm to parse music sheet images, produce the associated annotation, and implement a playback mechanism for the parsed musical notes.

This project includes:
Parsing horizontally aligned music sheets.
Generating ABC annotation.
Music playback.

Test Images
Twinkle Twinkle sheet music.
Jingle Bells sheet music.
Bach sheet music.
