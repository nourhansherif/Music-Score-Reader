# Music-Score-Reader
Optical music recognition (OMR) has been the subject of research for decades. Ideally, an OMR, given an image of a simple or complex music sheet, automatically identifies the notes, and plays the musical piece. An accessible and easy-to-use OMR application could provide an amazing tool for improving the musical education experience. For example, a novice musician could use such a tool to hear what a selected piece of music should sound like. 

For this project, our goal is to develop an algorithm to parse music sheet images, produce the associated annotation, and implement a playback mechanism for the parsed musical notes.

# This project includes: 
1) Parsing horizontally aligned music sheets.
2) Generating ABC annotation.
3) Music playback.

# Test Images 
1) Twinkle Twinkle sheet music.
2) Jingle Bells sheet music.
3) Bach sheet music.
